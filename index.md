# Anns typical day

For someone who doesn't have much going on, I have a lot going on! Here is a break down of things my wife and I have to do every day!

## Daily Chores ##
1. Feed the reptiles. We get up at 7:30 - 8am, reptiles have to eat before 9am!
2. Clean up reptile messes (poops) and make sure the humidifier is full and functioning.
3. Water the grass outside for the tortoise to eat after breakfast.
4. Clean out the little pool so he has fresh water.
5. Dust the house, Nevada is soooo dusty!
6. After that I usually do school all day unless we have to do something else. My wife does special chores each day, like laundry or other weekly chores.
7. I have to keep an eye on the weather and make sure Hiccup doesn't get too hot or too cold and bring him in around 4pm unless weather says differently.
8. Dogs eat Dinner at 5pm (Jay feeds them in the morning).
9. Just before sunset or when it is cool enough we play ball with the dogs, lately this is around 7:20pm.
10. Exercise! I love this part, my wife and I go for a walk. 

On top of the daily stuff, because of where we live we have to drive an hour into Las Vegas to get certain items we need! With only one Walmart for the largest town in the world it is often depleted!

By the time this is all done it is usually around 8 pm. We will either play a video game for a couple of hours or a board game or watch a movie. 

My wife and I love playing Monopoly! Here are just a few of the over 20 different monopolies that we own!

* The Mandalorian
* Lord of the Rings
* Game of Thrones
* Dead Pool
* Batman
* Stranger Things

The list goes on and they are all super cool! We also like to play video games on the switch. We recently got some new ones! My wife loves Pokemon Snap and is trying Little Nightmares (that one is too scary for me). I recently got into Pokemon Sword! I haven't even beat Let's go Pikachu yet! We got a game that we like to play together as well it is a Dance game, more exercise.
